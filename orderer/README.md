# orderer
While running, renames all files newly copied into an input folder. Does so in a monotonically increasing order.
These files will be named output_0.jpg, output_1.jpg, etc. in the order that they were copied in.
Sample use case: drag/drop files from separate folders into an input folder via file explorer.
